# ${1:Dynamic Corporate Employee Portfolio Page}

To build an employee portfolio in a corporate tech business. Adding dynamic features that would enable to see the Employee's name and accompanying profile information about the individual, with a click on their image. This inspiration for the portfolio was inspired by the Game of Thrones build from class. Initially, I was inspired to try a tree organization style of design but this proved to be too ambitious given the time and limited skill I possess, as I worked alone on this project.

#Roadmap

(1.) Create a spreed sheet that has four images. Split it up width and height respectively. This is to mimic in place of the shields. The end goal is to have full set of 4 new images ( greyscale and full colour).
(2.) Will have to line it up in photoeditor like photoshop. The method I used was to take screenshots of the circular images, to be in exact 400 x 400, crop the background out in photoshop, make it small and now have the small circular icons. Have it grey scaled in Photoshop too.Then drag and drop in the spreed sheet to remove any of the shield left over.
(3.) Add functionality, checkout Javascript file for commentary.
